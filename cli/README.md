# MobileCoin command-line interface
Command line interface and client library for MobileCoin full-service node.


## Install Python3 and Pip

Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Mac:
```shell
brew install python3
```

## Install mobcli

```shell
pip3 install .
```

Check that it is installed.
```shell
mobcli -h
```

## Configure mobcli

Copy the config file to your home directory.
```shell
cp mc_env.sh ~/.mc_env.sh
```

Add the following lines to your .bashrc:
```shell
if [ -f "$HOME/.mc_env.sh" ]; then
    source "$HOME/.mc_env.sh"
fi
```

The CLI sends its requests to the wallet service executable. Download it from https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/full-service/releases. Copy the file to the correct location.

```shell
cp full-service ~/.mobilecoin/testnet/full-service-testnet
```

The environment variables file specifies to connect to the test network by default, but
you can change it to connect to the main network if you know what you're doing, and are
confident you will not lose actual funds.


## Start the server

```shell
mobcli start
```

## Including the client library in packages

In order to reference the full-service Python client library for package dependencies, it is necessary to install via git, because it is not listed on PyPI. The pip install line for it is:

```
git+https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/full-service.git#subdirectory=cli
```
