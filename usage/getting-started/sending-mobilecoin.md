# Sending MobileCoin

The last step in developing your Wallet Interface is to connect to
the [build and submit transaction](../../api-endpoints/v2/transaction/transaction/build_and_submit_transaction.md)
endpoint. Sending transactions enables the Exchange to send MOB to customers, as well as to transfer MOB between
accounts that the Exchange controls.

{% hint style="info" %}
For all transactions, the input txos will be selected automatically unless the input txos are specified during the
transaction build step. This is generally not recommended and users should let input txos be automatically selected.
{% endhint %}

Review the initial balance of your account by
calling [`get_account_status`](../../api-endpoints/v2/account/account/get_account_status.md) with your `account_id`
generated from the [Create an Account section](receive-mob.md).

Since you are running a test that doesn't require you to review
the [transaction proposal](../../glossary/transaction-proposal.md) before submitting it to
the [ledger](../../glossary/ledger.md), call the convenience
method [`build_and_submit_transaction`](../../api-endpoints/v2/transaction/transaction/build_and_submit_transaction.md)
to send [MOB](../../glossary/mob.md) to a [public address](../../glossary/public-address.md). Keep note of
the `transaction_log_id` from the response, as we will need for the next step.

```javascript
async function buildAndSubmitTransaction() {
 const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:9090/wallet/v2', {
   method: 'POST',
   body: `{
     "method": "build_and_submit_transaction",
     "params": {
         "account_id": "1f32a...",
         "recipient_public_address": "3yNzpvKEpis...",
         "amount": {"value": "1000000000", "token_id": "0"}
     },
     "id": 1,
     "jsonrpc": "2.0"
   }`,
   headers: {
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   }
 });
 return await response.json();
}

buildAndSubmitTransaction().then((response) => {
 console.log(response);
});
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}

```python
from mobilecoin.client import ClientSync, Amount
client = ClientSync()
transaction_log, tx_proposal = client.build_and_submit_transaction(
    account_id='1f32a...',
    amount=Amount.from_display_units(1.0, 'MOB'),
    to_address='3yNzpvKEpis...',
)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To verify whether the [transaction](../../glossary/transaction.md) was successful,
call [`get_transaction_log`](../../api-endpoints/v2/transaction/transaction-log/get_transaction_log.md) with
the `transaction_log_id` from the previous step. The response will have a field called `status` which should
say `succeeded` once the [transaction](../../glossary/transaction.md) clears on
the [blockchain](../../glossary/blockchain.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
[Transactions](../../glossary/transaction.md) typically get processed
by [consensus](../../glossary/consensus-protocol.md) and are added to the [blockchain](../../glossary/blockchain.md) in
a few seconds. Once a block has appeared on the [blockchain](../../glossary/blockchain.md), it is finalized and does not
require waiting for a certain number of [blocks](../../glossary/block.md) to pass (unlike many other cryptocurrencies).
{% endhint %}

Congratulations, you just sent your first [transaction](../../glossary/transaction.md)!
