# Full Service API

The Full Service Wallet API provides http endpoints for interacting with your MobileCoin. See the [README](../README.md) for a full description of the http API.

## Full Service Data Types

The Full Service Wallet API provides several objects that correspond to the data types of the wallet

### The Account Object

#### Attributes

| *Name* | *Type* | *Description*
| :--- | :--- | :---
| account_id | string | Unique identifier for the account.
| name | string | Display name for the account.
| network_height | string (uint64) | The block height of MobileCoin's distributed ledger. The local_height is synched when it reaches the network_height.
| local_height | string (uint64) | The local block height downloaded from the ledger. The local database will sync up to the network_height. The account_height can only sync up to local_height.
| account_height| string (uint64) | The scanned local block height for this account. This value will never be greater than the local_height. At fully synced, it will match network_height.
| is_synced | boolean | Whether the account is synced with the network_height. Balances may not appear correct if the account is still syncing.
| available_pmob | string (uint64) | Available pico MOB for this account at the current account_height. If the account is syncing, this value may change.
| pending_pmob | string (uint64) | Pending, out-going pico MOB. The pending value will clear once the ledger processes the outgoing txos. The available_pmob will reflect the change.
| main_address | string | B58 Address Code for the account's main address. The main address is determined by the seed subaddress. It is not assigned to a single recipient, and should be consider a free-for-all address.

#### More attributes

| *Name* | *Type* | *Description*
| :--- | :--- | :---
| object | string, value is "account" | String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value
| next_subaddress_index | string (uint64) | This index represents the next subaddress to be assigned as an address. This is useful information in case the account is imported elsewhere.
| recovery_mode | boolean | A flag that indicates this imported account is attempting to un-orphan found TXOs. It is recommended to move all MOB to another account after recovery if the user is unsure of the assigned addresses.


#### Example Object

```
{
  "object": "account",
  "account_id": "1916a9b3...",
  "name": "I love MobileCoin",
  "network_height": "88888888",

| total_pending_pmob | string (uint64) | Pending out-going pico mob from ALL accounts. Pending pico mobs will clear once the ledger processes the outoing txo. The available_pmob will reflect the change.

### The TXO Object

#### Attributes

| *Name* | *Type* | *Description*
| :--- | :--- | :---
| value_pmob | string (uint64) | Available pico MOB for this account at the current account_height. If the account is syncing, this value may change.
| received_block_height | string (uint64) | Block height in which the txo was received by an account.
| spent_block_height | string (uint64) | Block height in which the txo was spent by an account.
| is_spent_recovered | boolean | Flag that indicates if the spent_block_height was recovered from the ledger. This value is null if the txo is unspent. If true, some information may not be available on the txo without user input. If true, the proof will be null without user input.
| received_account_id | string | The account_id for the account which has received this TXO. This account has spend authority.
| minted_account_i | string | The account_id for the account which minted this TXO.
| account_status_map | hash map | A normalized hash mapping account_id to account objects. Keys include "type" and "status".
| | key: txo_type | With respect to this account, the TXO may be "minted" or "received".
| | key: txo_status | With respect to this account, the TXO may be "unspent", "pending", "spent", "secreted" or "orphaned". For received TXOs received as an assigned address, the lifecycle is "unspent" -> "pending" -> "spent". For outbound, minted TXOs, we cannot monitor its received lifecycle status with respect to the minting account, we note its status as "secreted". If a TXO is received at an address unassigned (likely due to a recovered account or using the account on another client), the TXO is considered "orphaned" until its address is calculated -- in this case, there are manual ways to discover the missing assigned address for orphaned TXOs or to recover an entire account.

#### More attributes

| key_image (only on pending/spent) | string (hex) | a fingerprint of the txo derived from your private spend key materials, required to spend a txo
| offset_count | int | The value to offset pagination requests. Requests will exclude all list items up to and including this object.
