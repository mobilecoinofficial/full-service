  A TXO is a "Transaction Output." MobileCoin is a ledger built on the "Unspent
  Transaction Output" model (UTXO).

# Transaction Output TXO

In order to construct a transaction, the wallet will select "Unspent Transaction Outputs" and perform a cryptographic operation to mark them as "spent" in the ledger. Then, it will mint new TXOs for the recipient.

## Attributes <a id="object_method"></a>

| _Name_ | _Type_ | _Description_ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | string | |
| `value` | string \(uint64\) | Available value for this account at the current `account_block_height`. If the account is syncing, this value may change. |
| `token_id` | string \(uint64\) | |
| `received_block_index` | string \(uint64\) | Block index in which the TXO was received by an account. |
| `spent_block_index` | string \(uint64\) | Block index in which the TXO was spent by an account. |
| `account_id` | string | The `account_id` for the account which has received this TXO. This account has spend authority. |
| `status` | string \(enum\) | With respect to this account, the TXO may be "unverified", "unspent", "pending", "spent", "secreted" or "orphaned". For received TXOs received as an assigned address, the lifecycle is "unspent" -&gt; "pending" -&gt; "spent", the TXO is considered "orphaned" until its address is calculated -- in this case, there are manual ways to discover the missing assigned address for orphaned TXOs or to recover an entire account. |
| `target_key` | string \(hex\) | A cryptographic key for this TXO. |
| `public_key` | string \(hex\) | The public key for this TXO, can be used as an identifier to find the TXO in the ledger. |
| `e_fog_hint` | string \(hex\) | The encrypted fog hint for this TXO. |
| `subaddress_index` | string \(uint64\) | The assigned subaddress index for this TXO with respect to its received account. |
| `key_image` \(only on pending/spent\) | string \(hex\) | A fingerprint of the TXO derived from your private spend key materials, required to spend a TXO |
| `confirmation` | string \(hex\) | A confirmation that the sender of the TXO can provide to validate that they participated in the construction of this TXO. |
| `shared_secret` | string \(hex\) | The proto-encoded shared secret used to decode the masked amount in the TXO |
