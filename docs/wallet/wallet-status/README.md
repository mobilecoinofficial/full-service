# Wallet Status

## Attributes

| _Name_ | _Type_ | _Description_ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `object` | String, value is "wallet\_status" | String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. |
| `network_block_height` | String \(uint64\) | The block count of MobileCoin's distributed ledger. |
| `local_block_height` | String \(uint64\) | The local block count downloaded from the ledger. The local database is synced when the `local_block_height` reaches the `network_block_height`. The account_block_height can only sync up to `local_block_height`. |
| `is_synced_all` | Boolean | Whether ALL accounts are synced with the `network_block_height`. Balances may not appear correct if any account is still syncing. |
| `total_unspent_pmob` | String \(uint64\) | Unspent pico mob for ALL accounts at the `account_block_height`. If the account is syncing, this value may change. |
| `total_pending_pmob` | String \(uint64\) | Pending outgoing pico mob from ALL accounts. Pending pico mobs will clear once the ledger processes the outgoing TXO. The `available_pmob` will reflect the change. |
| `total_spent_pmob` | String \(uint64\) | Spent pico MOB. This is the sum of all the TXOs in the wallet which have been spent. |
| `total_secreted_pmob` | String \(uint64\) | Secreted \(minted\) pico MOB. This is the sum of all the TXOs which have been created in the wallet for outgoing transactions. |
| `total_orphaned_pmob` | String \(uint64\) | Orphaned pico MOB. The orphaned value represents the TXOs which were view-key matched, but which can not be spent until their subaddress index is recovered. |
| `account_ids` | List | A list of all `account_ids` imported into the wallet in order of import. |
| `account_map` | Hash map | A normalized hash mapping `account_id` to account objects. |
