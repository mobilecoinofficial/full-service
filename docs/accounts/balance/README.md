# Balance

## Attributes

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `object` | string, value is "balance" | String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. |
| `network_block_height` | string \(uint64\) | The block count of MobileCoin's distributed ledger. |
| `local_block_height` | string \(uint64\) | The local block count downloaded from the ledger. The local database is synced when the `local_block_height` reaches the `network_block_height`. The `account_block_height` can only sync up to `local_block_height`. | 
| `account_block_height` | string \(uint64\) | The scanned local block count for this account. This value will never be greater than `local_block_height`. At fully synced, it will match `network_block_height`.
| `is_synced` | boolean | Whether the account is synced with the `network_block_height`. Balances may not appear correct if the account is still syncing. |
| `unspent_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Unspent pico MOB for this account at the current `account_block_height`. If the account is syncing, this value may change. |
| `max_spendable_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Maximum pico MOB that can be sent in a single transaction for account at the current `account_block_height`. If the account is syncing, this value may change. It is the sum of the 16 (maximum number of inputs) largest spendable txos, minus the transaction fee. |
| `pending_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Pending, out-going pico MOB. The pending value will clear once the ledger processes the outgoing TXOs. The `pending_pmob` will reflect the change. |
| `spent_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Spent pico MOB. This is the sum of all the TXOs in the wallet which have been spent. |
| `secreted_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Secreted \(minted\) pico MOB. This is the sum of all the TXOs which have been created in the wallet for outgoing transactions. |
| `orphaned_pmob` | string \(uint64\) | Orphaned pico MOB. The orphaned value represents the TXOs which were view-key matched, but which can not be spent until their subaddress index is recovered. |
