# Subaddress

MobileCoin implements cryptonote-style subaddresses to allow funds to be received at a range of indexed public
addresses, all under the control of one set of private keys. Subaddresses allow an Exchange to track account balances
efficiently for a large number of users because a single cryptographic operation can identify incoming transactions for
the entire set of Exchange users associated with the account’s Master Key.

In addition, Exchanges can manage their account’s subaddresses in order to track information about deposits from users
and associate specific transactions with the user that sent the deposit.

When an Exchange customer wants to send MOB to the Exchange (e.g. the customer wishes to deposit funds to their account
at the Exchange), the Exchange assigns a monitored subaddress index to this customer and shares a Payment Request code
created using the public address corresponding to the customer’s assigned subaddress index.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is the Exchange’s responsibility to manage their subaddresses in a way that allows transactions to be associated with
the user that sent them.
{% endhint %}

The Exchange then shares the Payment Request code with the customer. When the customer fulfills the Payment Request to
complete the deposit, the Exchange observes the incoming payment in the ledger at the assigned subaddress index. The
payment is then reflected in the balance of the subaddress assigned to the customer.

{% hint style="info" %}
Subaddresses are not intended to be used to track a users balance, but more so as a “revolving door” of incoming
payments. When sending a transaction to someone, txos are selected from the entire account’s available unspent txos.
